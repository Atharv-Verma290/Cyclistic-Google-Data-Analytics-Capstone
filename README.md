## Deliverables

- A clear statement of the business task
- Description of data sources and data cleaning documentation
- Summary of findings and visualizations
- Three key recommendations for converting casual riders into members

## Tools

This project utilized:
- **SQL**: Data cleaning and transformation
- **R/RStudio**: Data aggregation and analysis
- **Data Visualization tools**: PowerPoint and R for final visualizations

## Data Source
The dataset can be accessed from [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This dataset includes trip details such as trip duration, start and end times, station locations, and user membership types. 

## Data Processing
SQL is used to process the data.
1. The data is combined for each month into a single year table.
2. Irrelevent columns like start and end station information, ride id are dropped.
3. Timestamp data is split into date, time, month, hour, time of day, season for analysis.
4. Trip duration is calculated from start and end time.

## Analysis and Insights
The data analysis and visualization is done using R and RStudio in the [Cyclistic_2023_data_viz.Rmd](https://github.com/Atharv-Verma290/Cyclistic-Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/Cyclistic_2023_data_viz.Rmd) 

## Recommendations

Three recommendations and visualizations based on this analysis are included in the [report](https://github.com/Atharv-Verma290/Cyclistic-Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/cyclistic%202023%20case%20study%20report.pptx) to guide Cyclistic's marketing strategy.
